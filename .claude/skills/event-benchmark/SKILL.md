# Event-recognition benchmark

Use `tools/event_benchmark/SPEC.md` as the authority. Current checkout: **v2**,
with strict answers, complete frame evidence and reviewed input hashes. Historical
v1 outputs are not v2 evidence. Inspect the current spec and runner before a run.
These instructions do not authorize paid inference, downloads, uploads or publishing;
use the user's authorized scope and budget.

## Workflow

1. **Freeze the inputs before scoring.** Identify the candidate, dataset, reviewed
   manifest, media directories and output path. Verify manifest review status,
   samples hash, question/label identities and media hashes. The runner does this
   before requests. Do not change a draft status to bypass review.
   `manifest_50.json` is reviewed; `manifest_120.json` is currently draft and
   includes 100 base-event questions plus 20 separate bag-search questions.
   Question count is not unique-video count. Larger sets require their own reviewed
   manifest. Never assume a colleague's Desktop path exists.
2. **Run accuracy from the repository root**, only after authorization for calls:
   ```sh
   python tools/event_benchmark/run_eval.py --candidate luna \
     --samples /path/to/samples.json --manifest /path/to/reviewed-manifest.json \
     --media /path/to/media1 /path/to/media2 \
     --interval 1.0 --workers 12 --out outputs/event-benchmark/luna-v2.json
   ```
   Repeat with qwen and gemini on identical inputs. Capture the source commit and
   result-file SHA-256 alongside the runner's samples/manifest/media/runner/spec
   hashes. Keep generated data in ignored `outputs/`, not tracked `results/`.
3. **Measure latency separately**, with the same input and question per candidate:
   ```sh
   python .claude/skills/event-benchmark/scripts/latency_bench.py \
     --candidate luna --video /path/to/representative-clip.mp4 \
     --concurrency 12 --rounds 6 --out outputs/event-benchmark/lat-luna.json
   ```
   This is single-frame, single-predicate request latency, not product latency or
   twelve-camera throughput. Inspect failures and completion status before reporting.
4. **Report** using `references/report-format.md`, including coverage and provenance.
   Use `bench-sheet-contribute` only when publishing is requested. Its default
   preparation is an offline preview, with no sheet write.

## Frozen v2 baseline

- Same questions from `samples.json`, same media, 1 fps centered frame schedule,
  720px width, one independent request per frame; output envelope fixed by backend.
- Language: complete JSON boolean. Luna: finite numeric probability in [0,1].
  No truthiness coercion of strings/numbers, no invalid response treated as negative.
- Clip score = maximum of **all scheduled valid frames**; `score >= 0.5` is yes.
  Any missing frame or invalid answer after three total attempts makes the clip an
  error, even if another frame was positive.
- v2 accuracy excludes error clips: report correct/valid **and** attempted/errors,
  per event and overall. Never compare success-only percentages without coverage.
- `--dense` or changed cadence is a separately labeled sensitivity experiment.
  Tuning is a separate variant; see `bench-threshold-tune`.
- Dataset growth changes the dataset fingerprint and comparison cohort. It does not
  itself change the sampling spec; rerun every compared candidate on the same set.
- Provisional labels may be described as historical/exploratory evidence only, never
  as reviewed v2 results. No new official run until the manifest is reviewed.
  Explicitly authorized `--provisional` diagnostics use `base4-provisional-v1`
  (`tools/event_benchmark/PROVISIONAL.md`), support only binary base-4 questions,
  and record rather than verify input hashes. They cannot be used for v2 tuning.
  Bag yes/no/unknown questions require a separate reviewed scoring protocol;
  never collapse unknown into no or remove the third answer to fit this runner.
- No negatives means specificity unavailable, not zero false positives.

## Other model classes

`run_eval.py` currently supports language and Luna decision backends. Native
VideoJev and CLIP have different protocols. Read `references/model-classes.md`
before importing their results; shared formatting does not establish a controlled
comparison. Do not coerce margins or native verdicts into Luna probabilities.

- `references/model-classes.md`: runner boundaries and cross-class reporting.
